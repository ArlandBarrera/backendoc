IP stands for \emph{Internet Protocol}.

There are two main versions of the Internet Protocol: the older, but still widely used, \textbf{IPv4} and the more recent and scalable \textbf{IPv6}.

An IP Adress is a unique numerical label assigned to every device, such as a computer, phone or server; that is connected to a computer network or the internet.

When information is sent online, it is broken into smaller pieces calles data packets. The IP adress acts as the "electronic return adress" for these packets, ensuring they arrive at the correct destination.

IP adresses can be public or private.
