Is a globally unique address used for devices to communicate on the internet, assign by the \textit{Internet Service Provider} (\textbf{ISP}) to a home or router. Enables access to the internet and online services. It is global and unique across the internet, visible to anyone on the internet.

Example of this are a website's server or a router's IP address when accessing the internet. Outside private IP addresses, the rest are public.

Public IP addresses can be traced back to the ISP that can easily trace the geographical location. This might reveal the location very esaily to advertisers, hackers, etc. For using the Internet anonymously, the IP address can be hidden by using different ways like VPN, Tor Browser, etc. But among different ways, VPN is the fastest and most secure way of using the Internet.
