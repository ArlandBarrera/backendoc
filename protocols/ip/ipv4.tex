The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address is the older version. It is one of the core protocols of the standards-based methods used to interconnect the internet and other networks. It was deployed on the \textit{Atlantic Packet Satellite Network} (SATNET), which was a satellite network, in 1982. It is still used to route most internet traffic despite the existence of IPv6.

IPv4 is currently assigned to all computers. An IPv4 address uses \textbf{32-bit} binary numbers to form a unique IP address. It takes the format of four sets of numbers, each within ranges from \textbf{0} to \textbf{255} and represents and eight-digit binary number, separated by a period point.

The \textbf{full range} of IP addresses can go from \textbf{0.0.0.0} to \textbf{255.255.255.255}. The \textbf{total combination} of IP addresses is $2^{32}$ = \textbf{4 294 967 296} (four billion, two hundred ninety-four million, nine hundred sixty-seven thousand, two hundred ninety-six)

Some IP addresses are reserved for networks that carry a specific purpose on the TCP/IP. Four of these IP addresses classes innclude:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{0.0.0.0:} In IPv4 is also known as the \textbf{default network}. It is the non-routable meta address that designates an invalid, non-applicable, or unknown network target.
  \item \textbf{127.0.0.1:} Is known as the \textbf{loopback address}, also known as \textbf{localhost}, which a computer uses to identify itself regardless of whether it has been assigned and IP address.
  \item \textbf{169.254.0.1} to \textbf{169.254.254.254:} A range of addresses that are automatically assigned if a computer is unsuccessful in an attempt to receive an address from the DHCP.
  \item \textbf{255.255.255.255:} An address dedicated to messages that need to be sent to every computer on a network or \textbf{broadcasted across a network}.
\end{itemize}

Further reserved IP addresses are for what is known as \textbf{subnet classes}. A \textbf{subnet} IP is a logically smaller division within a lerger IP network, crated through a process called subnetting. Subnetting divides a large network into smaller, more managable segments, or subnets, wich allows for more efficient data routing, improved network performance and better security.

Each subnet is assigned a unique range of IP addresses, and a \textbf{subnet mask} is used to identify which part of an IP address belongs to the network and which part belongs to the host device within that subnet.

\textbf{Subnetting}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{IP Address Structure:} An IP address is logically divided into two parts: a network number (or routing prefix) and a host identifier.
  \item \textbf{Subnet Mask:} A subnet mask is used to determine these two parts of an IP address. It's a number with a specific bit pattern, where the bits set to `\textbf{1}' indicate indicate the \textbf{network portion}, and the bits set to `\textbf{0}' indicate the \textbf{host portion}.
  \item \textbf{Logical Divison:} By changing some of the bits from the host portion to the network portion, an administrator can effectively create smaller subnets from a single, larger network.
\end{enumerate}

For example \textbf{255.255.0.0} in binary is \textbf{11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000}, `\textbf{1}' refers to the network part and `\textbf{0}' to the host part.

The router on a TCP/IP network can be configured to ensure it recognizes subnets, then route the traffic onto the appropriate network. IP addresses are reserved for the following subnets:

Class A addresses \textbf{127.0.0.0} to \textbf{127.255.255.255} cannot be used and are reserved for loopback testing.

Fundamental networking formulas are based on the number of bits allocated for network and host parts in the subnet mask.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Number of subnets:} total subnets = $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of bits borrowed from the original host part to create more network bits in subnetting.
  \item \textbf{Number of usable hosts:} usable hosts = $2^h - 2$, where $h$ is the number of bits used for hosts in the subnet mask. The substraction of 2 accounts for the network and broadcast address, which cannot be assigned to hosts.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key elements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Total bits for IPv4}, $T = 32$.
  \item \textbf{Network bits} = $n$.
  \item \textbf{Number of subnets} = $2^n$.
  \item \textbf{Host bits}, $h = T - n$.
  \item \textbf{Usable hosts} = $2^h - 2$.
\end{itemize}
