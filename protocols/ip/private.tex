Used for devices within a LAN (like a home or an office), is not accessible from the Internet, and is assigned by a router. This facilitates communication between devices on a private network, offering increased security by limiting external visibility. Examples are a computer's or smat TV's IP address when connected to a home Wi-Fi.

By using private IP addresses internally, organizations can avoid the need to obtain and manage large blocks of public IP addresses, reducing costs associated with Internet connectivity. Requires \textit{Network Address Translation} (\textbf{NAT}), which can cause overhead in terms of processing energy, latency, and complexity, in particular in big-scale deployments.

The range of private IP addresses are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Class A:} \texttt{10.0.0.0} - \texttt{10.255.255.255}, for large networks with many devices.
\item \textbf{Class B:} \texttt{172.16.0.0} - \texttt{172.31.255.255}, for medium-sized networks, such as schools or businesses.
\item \textbf{Class C:} \texttt{192.168.0.0} - \texttt{192.168.255.255}, for small networks, such as homes or small offices.
\end{itemize}
